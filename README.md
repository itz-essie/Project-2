## Description

This project is a full stack application that allows users cure their COVID lonliness by collecting and displaying COVID-friendly date/activity ideas for the user to participate in, if they wish. This application will display user-input date/activity ideas as well as allow users to submit additional date/activity ideas. Our application is designed for the user to select the activity type they would like to explore (entertainment, virtual, food & drink, sports, and outdoor recreation) and then filter the results by their state to see those activities in their area, submitted by other users. Each date/activity has information such as city, state, cost, description, "Stepping Out Insider Info" (exclusive activity information/tips/go-to-knows only available on Stepping Out), and rating.
